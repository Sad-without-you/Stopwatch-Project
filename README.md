# Stopwatch Project

This is a simple digital stopwatch built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The stopwatch can track time, save recorded times in a table, and reset the timer. It was a great project to practice working with time intervals and manipulating the DOM.

## Features

- **Real-time Timer**: Tracks hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Save Recorded Times**: Ability to save up to 7 recorded times in a table.
- **Reset Function**: Resets the timer and clears the saved times.
- **Tick Sound**: Plays a ticking sound for each second.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout, including table and button design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for the timer, saving times, and UI updates.
